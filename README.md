# Motor-Control-With-Arduino
This repository contains a mini-project, DC motor control system, based on arduino uno R3.
The system consists of arduino uno R3, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), motor driver (L298N) and 2 DC motors.
The motors speed is controlled by the measured value from the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and act as an auto-braking system.
